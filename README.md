# Portfolio 2019

This it my personal/portfolio site. It's being deployed on Netlify and connected to a headless CMS deployed on Heroku.

The main purpose of this site is to have a longterm project that's easy to maintain and create content for. This project will help me work on proper deploy and release procedures which will develop over time.

I'll also add `projects` and `issues` over time.
